Bot vs. Bot Chatting

This project is using the great [ChatterBot API](https://code.google.com/p/chatter-bot-api/)!

Loaded with async pulling, text2speech and a visual display (IFrame)!


**NOTE:** I' m currently refactoring the UI of the little app and how the settings are getting displayed.

I really don' t like the way these JOptionsPanes look and work. Stay tuned.
